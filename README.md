NumericalTestRigFlows (NTRFlows)

A Snakemake workflow for `parameterstudies in cfd-simulations`

## Deployment and Usage

Be aware, that this repository is still in early development. There are tons of issues left and the workflow will change quite a bit until it is productive.

Currently, the workflow is deployed via git. Simply clone the repo and start the workflow using snakemake.

The only dependencies needed are "snakemake, pandas, singularity/conda and slurm"

Currently the usage of the workflow is limited to
```console
foo@bar:/path/to/project-workdir$ git clone -b master https://github.com/MaNyh/NTRFlows.git 
foo@bar:/path/to/project-workdir$ snakemake -j 1 --use-singularity --profile profiles/slurm
```

There will be another deployment-option that is described in the Snakemake Workflow Catalog (see Documentation below)


## Documentation

The usage of this workflow is described in the [Snakemake Workflow Catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/?usage=MaNyh%2FNTRFlows).
