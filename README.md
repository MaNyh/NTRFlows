NumericalTestRigFlows (NTRFlows)

A Snakemake workflow for `parameterstudies in cfd-simulations`

## Deployment and Usage

Be aware, that this repository is still in early development. There are tons of issues left and the workflow will change quite a bit until it is productive.

Currently, the workflow is deployed via git. Simply clone the repo and start the workflow using snakemake.

The only dependencies needed are "snakemake, pandas, singularity/conda and slurm"

BE AWARE!

There are two configuration files where the number of processors have to be defined equally. 

- config/workflowsettings.yaml
- profiles/slurm/config.yaml

This issue is documented in https://github.com/MaNyh/NTRFlows/issues/1 
It is crucial to solve this issue as soon as possible

```console
foo@bar:/path/to/somedirectory$ git clone -b master https://github.com/MaNyh/NTRFlows.git 
foo@bar:/path/to/somedirectory$ cd NTRFlows
foo@bar:/path/to/somedirectory/NTRFlows$ snakemake -j 1 -c16 --use-singularity --profile profiles/slurm
```

There will be another deployment-option that is described in the Snakemake Workflow Catalog (see Documentation below)
